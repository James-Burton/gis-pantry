Check_all.js is a script supplied by Brian McDonald to James Burton on December 11, 2019 for use as an in-browser snippet for BC Government online forms that require all boxes to be checked. 

Primarily used for "Map Report Conflicts" screen in FTA prior to clicking "Resolve Selected Conflicts". It is recommended that "save and excepts" or "excluding thereouts" etc be manually added.

For implementation of this code within a Google Chrome browser: 

Within the DevTools (Crtl-Shift-i), navigate to the sources tab, where you can access a “Snippets” section. This platform allows you to save code used frequently, such as Check_all. I created a “Snippet” called Check_all and copied and pasted the javascript within the "Snippet" console. Save the script to a script folder on your drive. To run the code you simply open the devtools, navigate to your desired "Snippet" and run it by pressing ctrl-enter.
